## Why a new layout

After 2 months of using the stock Ergodox EZ keyboard, I found that the default key mapping is
leave something to be desired for my daily use. Thus this keymap was created to address it.

I use the keyboard mostly for programming work, so maybe this will help if you have the same usecase.
Here, I will also present key ideas that shaped the keyboard they way it is.

## A little context

So here is my setup for programming work:

- Editor: **Vim**. Sometimes (<5%, I would use Sublime)
- Browser: Chrome + Vimium, which allow me to use Vim-like bindings to navigate a web site
- I also use **Tmux** to handle multiple session on the terminal
- Wrist condition:  My hand and wrist started to hurt a little since 2013, due to repetitive stress
  injury (also main reason I started looking into ergonomic keyboard), so being able to type a lot
  without minimum effort matters a lot to me.
- Speed: I am currently at 80 wpm and would like to read 90-100 soon

## What I type

I work with languages that use braces to indicate scope a lot (Go, Ruby, Js, etc),
so typing braces easily
